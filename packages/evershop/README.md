## TypeScript Development

This package uses a hybrid JavaScript/TypeScript approach. All new code should ideally be written in TypeScript, and existing JavaScript code can be gradually migrated.

### TypeScript Configuration

The `tsconfig.json` file is configured for:

- ES modules output (ESM)
- JSX preservation
- Type declaration generation
- Source mapping
- Support for both .js and .ts/.tsx files

### Development Workflow

1. **Running the development server**:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

   This uses `tsx` to directly run TypeScript files without pre-compilation.

2. **Type checking**:

   ```
   npm run typecheck
   ```

   Runs TypeScript compiler in check-only mode without emitting files.

3. **Building the package**:

   ```
   npm run build:ts
   ```

   Compiles TypeScript files to JavaScript in the `dist` directory.

4. **Watch mode during development**:
   ```
   npm run build:watch
   ```
   Automatically recompiles when files change.

### Package Exports

The package exports specific modules that can be imported by consumers:

```js
// Main package exports
import { Area, Circle } from '@amohajewellery/amohajewellery';

// Utility functions
import { get, getEnv } from '@amohajewellery/amohajewellery/src/lib/util';

// Common components
import { Area } from '@amohajewellery/amohajewellery/src/components/common';

// Type definitions
import type { Route } from '@amohajewellery/amohajewellery/types';
```

### File Organization

- `/src` - Source code
  - `/components` - React components
  - `/lib` - Utility functions and libraries
  - `/modules` - Application modules
- `/bin` - CLI commands and scripts
- `/types` - TypeScript type definitions

### Adding New TypeScript Files

When adding new TypeScript files:

1. Use `.ts` extension for plain TypeScript files
2. Use `.tsx` extension for files containing JSX
3. Export the file from an appropriate index.ts file if it should be part of the public API
